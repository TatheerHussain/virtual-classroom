### Virtual Classroom
Utilize affordable 360 cameras and VR headset like Google Cardboard to create a virtual environment.

#### General Idea
As virtual reality (VR) becoming mature, and reasonable priced 360 cameras entering the consumer market; it is possible to visualize a workspace (classroom, meeting room, office etc.) using 360 cameras to record the space, stream through the Internet and view through a VR headset. This project explores this idea and will create a prototype by the end of the semester.

#### Work-flow
- Instructor have existing course website where student can enroll in/access.
- For each lecture, the instructor setup a 360 camera in their lecture hall, and turn it on during lecture.
- Student can join a lecture session if there is currently a lecture.
- With Google Cardboard (or similar VR headset, since Oculus Rift and HTC Vive are probably too expensive for most students) and using WebVR, students can view the live stream and possibly with interactions.

#### Time-line
- **Phase 1**: Create site for lecturers and students to login and start lecture stream
- **Phase 2**: Ability to divide students into groups during lecture
- **Phase 3**: TBD (maybe a better structured website where lecture streams are stored and students can re-watch it anytime)

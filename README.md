### Virtual Classroom
Utilize affordable 360 cameras and VR headset like Google Cardboard to create a virtual environment.

The project is under supervision of Professor Steve Engels and Professor Paul Gries at the University of Toronto

#### General Idea
As virtual reality (VR) becoming mature, and reasonable priced 360 cameras entering the consumer market; it is possible to visualize a workspace (classroom, meeting room, office etc.) using 360 cameras to record the space, stream through the Internet and view through a VR headset. This project explores this idea and will create a prototype by the end of the semester.
